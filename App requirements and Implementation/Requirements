Project Scope: Simulation of train arrivals and departures on Zone 1 of London Underground network. 

//Requirements

- Live clock that displays the current time.

- Schedule system for each train with departing and arrival time. The simulation would simulate in Zone 1 London only, however
I would simulate 5 stations from there.

- Arrival system that logs every train arrival and displays them. 

//Extras
