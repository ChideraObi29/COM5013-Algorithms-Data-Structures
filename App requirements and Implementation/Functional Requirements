CREATING A CLOCK SYSTEM 
This can be done by getting the current time and then printing it on the screen. This should be more efficient than creating a fake 
time that would require more lines of codes and a variable that keeps have to change.

CREATING SCHEDULES FOR TRAINS USING ARRAYS
- I will set each train at a different station at the start of the program.
- Stations: Waterloo, Euston, King's Cross, Paddington and Victoria.
- Each station would have their own different distance in time.
- I will store each schedule in arrays
